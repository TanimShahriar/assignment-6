    <div class="collapse-content">
      <p><span class="text-xl font-semibold">1. var:</span>
        Variables declared with var have function scope or global scope, but not block scope. This means that var
        variables are accessible throughout the entire function in which they are declared, or globally if declared
        outside of any function. <br> <br>

        <span class="text-xl font-semibold">2. let:</span>
        Variables declared with let have block scope, meaning they are accessible only within the block where they are
        declared. <br> <br>

        <span class="text-xl font-semibold">3. const:</span>
        Variables declared with const also have block scope like let. However, const variables are constants and cannot
        be reassigned after they are defined.

    <div class="collapse-content">
      <p> <span class="text-xl font-semibold">1. null:</span>
        Explicit Absence of Value: null is often used to explicitly indicate that a variable or object property has no
        value.
        Resetting Values: You can assign null to a variable or object property to indicate that it should no longer hold
        its current value. it's good practice to use null when we want to explicitly represent the absence of a value or
        indicate that a value has been intentionally removed or reset. <br> <br>
        <span class="text-xl font-semibold">2. undefined:</span> <br>
        Uninitialized Variables: When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it has an undefined value by
        default. <br>
        Missing Object Properties: When you try to access an object property that doesn't exist, the result is
        undefined. <br>
        Function Parameters: If a function is called with fewer arguments than expected, the missing parameters are
        undefined. <br>
        Implicit Return Value: If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it returns undefined. <br>
        Falsy Value: undefined is considered a falsy value in JavaScript.

      What do you mean by REST API?
    </div>
    <div class="collapse-content">
      <p>REST API stands for "Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface." It is a set of
        conventions and architectural principles used for building and interacting with web services over the HTTP
        protocol. REST APIs enable communication between different software systems, allowing them to request and
        exchange data in a standardized way. <br> <br>

        Key characteristics of REST APIs include: <br> <br>

        <span class="text-xl font-semibold">1. Statelessness:</span> Each API request from a client to the server must
        contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server doesn't store any client
        state between requests. This makes REST APIs scalable and easy to cache. <br>

        <span class="text-xl font-semibold"> Resources:</span> 2. REST APIs are built around the concept of resources,
        which are identified by unique URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). Resources can be any kind of data, such as user
        profiles, products, or blog posts. <br>

        <span class="text-xl font-semibold">3. HTTP Methods:</span> REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (verbs) to
        indicate the type of operation to be performed on a resource. The most common methods are:
        - GET: Retrieve data from the server.
        - POST: Create new data on the server.
        - PUT: Update data on the server.
        - DELETE: Remove data from the server. <br>

        <span class="text-xl font-semibold">4. HTTP Status Codes:</span> REST APIs use standard HTTP status codes to
        indicate the outcome of a request. For example, 200 OK for a successful response, 404 Not Found for a missing
        resource, and 500 Internal Server Error for server-related errors. <br>

        <span class="text-xl font-semibold">5. Uniform Interface:</span> REST APIs follow a uniform interface, which
        means that regardless of the application, the principles of handling resources are consistent. <br>

        <span class="text-xl font-semibold">6. Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS):</span> This
        principle suggests that a client should be able to navigate through the API using hyperlinks provided in the
        responses. This allows the API to evolve without requiring clients to change. <br>

        <span class="text-xl font-semibold">7. Content Negotiation:</span> Clients and servers can negotiate the format
        of data being exchanged. Common formats include JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup
        Language). <br> <br>

        REST APIs are widely used for building web applications, mobile apps, and other distributed systems. They
        provide a standardized way for different applications to communicate, enabling interoperability and decoupling
        between client and server components. Many modern web services, including social media platforms, e-commerce
        sites, and cloud services, expose RESTful APIs for developers to interact with their data and services.
